##Information

This project was used to help me keep track of Comtek audio Recievers while working on location in the film business. I ran it on a battery powered raspberry piattached to an rc-522 rfid scanner and a 1x16 lcd display powered by the pi's gpio bus. Everything was contained in a small pelican case for weather proofing.
